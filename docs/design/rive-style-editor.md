# Rive-style Scene + Component Editor — Plan (draft, owner review)

> Status: **PROPOSED, not started.** Owner ask (2026-10-08): make the Scene Editor and the
> Component Editor work like [Rive](https://rive.app/) — components built on the stage, timelines
> and a state machine attached to each component, a friendlier interface, and everything wired to
> Invisible Flow. This file is the plan; progress will live in [editor status](../status/editor.md)
> and [component-editor status](../status/component-editor.md).
>
> **Owner direction (2026-10-08, second pass):**
> 1. **A hybrid, not a copy of Rive.** Screens stay — we keep the Screens list, spaces, layer
>    order and Flow driving screens. Rive's ideas are taken where they fit.
> 2. **Timelines are reusable, and there is only one timeline system:** the Rigger's
>    [Invisible Cinematic](invisible-cinematic.md) timeline, extended. No second timeline is built.
>
> ⚠️ Phase 5 **reverses a standing decision**: [invisible-editor.md §8.7](invisible-editor.md) and
> §17 deferred "route A — Rive state machine" (2026-06-05, re-confirmed 2026-06-09). The owner
> needs to lift that deferral, scoped to *component* state machines (§2). §17's planned
> `BehaviorTrack`/`TweenStep` timeline is superseded by §4 here; neither was ever built.

## 1. The hybrid: what we keep, what we take from Rive

| Area | Keep (ours) | Take from Rive |
|---|---|---|
| **Screens** | Screens list, spaces (`game`/`standard`/`canvas`/`background`), list order = layer order, device layouts, In-game view | Screens can carry timelines (enter / exit / idle) played by Flow |
| **Game logic** | **Invisible Flow** is the game's top-level state machine: book events, screens, wins, features | — (Rive's root state machine is what Flow already is) |
| **Components** | `ComponentDef`, params, versions, per-project defaults, value bindings, the ship chain | Edited **in place on the stage**; **Animate mode**; a **state machine** with **inputs**; **listeners** (pointer events → inputs) |
| **Timelines** | The **Cinematic** timeline from `/rigger` (format, evaluator, player, UI) | Timelines on any component or screen, reusable across them |
| **Flow ↔ component** | `playCinematic`, `fireCue` | Flow sets a component's inputs, fires its triggers, waits on its states |

So: **screens are where things live, Flow decides what happens, components are the Rive part.**
Rive's artboards map to our components; Rive's main artboard maps to a screen; Rive's state machine
inputs are what Flow drives.

## 2. The scope line

- **Component state machine (new)** — presentation only: states play timelines, transitions fire
  on inputs. No RGS calls, no math, no book reading. Lives on the `ComponentDef`.
- **Screens get no state machine of their own.** Flow already is one; a second would compete with it.
- **Flow (existing)** — owns the game logic and drives component inputs.
- **Game math** — stays in books and Game Config. Untouched.

## 3. One timeline system (the Cinematic timeline, extended)

What exists today (see [cinematic status](../status/cinematic.md)):

- **Format** — `CinematicDoc` (`engine-layout`) with tracks (`packages/engine-cinematic/types.ts`):
  `animation` (rig clip strips, layers, blends, masks), `property` (keyed x / y / scale / rotation /
  alpha), `visibility`, `cue` (`fx:` / `sfx:` / `music:` / `signal:`), `camera`, and
  **`subCinematic`** (a timeline inside a timeline). A cinematic can already bind a **Scene** as its
  set (`stage.sceneId`).
- **Evaluator** — `engine-cinematic` (`evaluateActor`, channel sampling, `cuesCrossed`),
  deterministic and gated (118/118 headless).
- **Player** — `<Cinematic>` in `engine-layout/svelte`, played from Flow's `playCinematic`.
- **Storage + ship** — `<client>/<project>/cinematics/<id>.json` → `cinematicExport.ts` →
  `deploy/cinematics/` → bake → `bakedCinematic(id)`.
- **UI** — the sequencer + dopesheet in `/rigger` 🎬 Cinematic mode (`static/rigger/cinematic.js`).

The one limit: **actors are rigs only.** Everything below generalises that, additively.

### 3.1 Node actors

An actor gains a kind:

```ts
type CinematicActor =
	| { id: string; kind?: 'rig'; rig: string; /* today's fields */ }
	| { id: string; kind: 'node'; target: string };   // a node in the host, by node name
```

- A `node` actor is any layout node in the timeline's **host** (§3.2): sprite, text, rect, rig
  node, flipbook, FX, nested component instance.
- `property` channels widen for node actors: `x y scaleX scaleY rotation alpha` (today) + `tint`,
  `frame` (flipbook), `fill` (reveal), `text` (count-up to a number input).
- A rig **node** can still take `animation` strips, so the cinematic rig controls carry over.
- Unknown kinds are skipped by the evaluator already (`types.ts` header), so old players and old
  docs are unaffected. Every existing cinematic keeps `kind` absent, which reads as `'rig'`.

### 3.2 Hosts

A timeline names what it animates:

```ts
host?: { kind: 'cast' }                        // today's cinematic: rigs on their own stage (default)
     | { kind: 'component'; componentId: string }
     | { kind: 'screen'; sceneId: string }
```

Same document, same store, same export and bake. A component's state can point at a timeline id, a
screen's enter/exit can, and Flow's `playCinematic` can play any of them.

### 3.3 Reuse

Timelines are reusable in four ways:

1. **Same timeline, many callers.** One timeline can be played by Flow (`playCinematic`), by a
   component state, or as a `subCinematic` track inside another timeline.
2. **Bind by node name.** A node actor targets a node *name*, not an id. So a "Pop in" timeline made
   on one component plays on any component or screen that has a node of that name. Tracks that
   find no node are flagged by validation and skipped at runtime (the evaluator already skips
   what it can't resolve).
3. **Shared library.** Timelines can be promoted to `_shared/cinematics/`, like shared components.
   The shared library is where the old §17 "presets" (fade, slide, pop, count-up) live: as real
   timelines anyone can open and edit, not as a coded list.
4. **Instances.** A placed component instance plays its def's timelines. Per-instance overrides
   stay on params, as today; the timeline itself is not forked per instance.

### 3.4 One timeline UI

The sequencer lives in `/rigger`'s static vanilla-JS page; `/editor` is Svelte. Plan: extract the
timeline panel (ruler, tracks, strips, keys, cue rows, inspector, undo) from
`static/rigger/cinematic.js` into a **framework-agnostic module**, `mount(el, { doc, host,
callbacks })`. `/rigger` and `/editor` both mount it; `/editor` wraps it in a small Svelte
component. It ships to the static page the same way `cinematicEval.mjs` does today: a generated
verbatim copy, with a gate that fails when the two differ. `/rigger` keeps the rig-specific parts
(Tweak Mode, inline posing, bone masks) as extensions the module takes.

## 4. Target experience

```
┌ ToolTopBar ───────────────────────── [ Design | Animate ] ── Save · History ┐
│ Screens            │                 Stage                                   │ Inspector │

├────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┤

│          [State machine]  Entry → Idle ⇄ Win → Exit   Inputs: win ▸  amount #   (comps)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Design mode** is today's Scene Editor. Screens are listed first, then components, which are
  edited on the same stage (breadcrumb in, Esc out). `/components` becomes this view with a
  component selected.
- **Animate mode** opens the shared sequencer for whatever is selected: a screen's timelines, or a
  component's timelines plus its state machine tab.
- **Flow** keeps `/flow-v2`. Its palette lists every component's inputs and states, and its
  inspector deep-links to the component or timeline.

## 5. Component state machine (additive to `ComponentDef`)

```ts
interface ComponentInput { id: string; kind: 'bool' | 'number' | 'trigger'; default?: boolean | number }

interface ComponentStateMachine {
	layers: { id: string; entry: string; states: SmState[]; transitions: SmTransition[] }[];
}
// SmState:      { id, timeline: string /* cinematic id */, speed?, loop? } | 'any' | 'exit'
// SmTransition: { from, to, conditions: (bool == | number < > == | trigger fired)[],
//                 exitTime?, blend? }
```

- **Inputs** absorb what `signals` do for behaviour: a signal reads as a trigger input, and an
  engine param (`winAmount`) can feed a number input.
- **Listeners** are a node field: `on: 'down' | 'up' | 'enter' | 'leave' | 'click'` sets an input or
  fires a trigger. Button `stateAnimations` become a seeded state machine.
- The graph editor reuses `@xyflow/svelte`, as `/flow-v2` does.
- Existing `signals`, `cues`, `stateAnimations` and `valueBindings` keep working. Phase 8
  migrates them; nothing is migrated earlier.

## 6. Phased build (each phase ships, parity-gated)

| # | Phase | Delivers | Main code | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Decisions + ADR** | Owner signs off §8; §8.7/§17 of `invisible-editor.md` point here | docs | S |
| 1 | **Node actors + hosts** | §3.1–3.2 in the format, evaluator and `<Cinematic>` player; existing cinematics byte-identical | `engine-cinematic`, `engine-layout`, rigger-spike gates | M |
| 2 | **Extract the sequencer** | §3.4: `/rigger` runs on the shared module with every cinematic gate still green | `static/rigger/cinematic.js` → shared module | L |
| 3 | **Animate a screen** | Animate mode in `/editor` for a screen; Flow `playCinematic` plays it in game. **First end-to-end proof**, no state machine needed | `routes/(app)/editor`, Svelte wrapper | M |
| 4 | **Components in place** | Components listed in `/editor`, edit in place with a breadcrumb, `/components` folds in; component timelines | `routes/(app)/editor`, `components/+page.svelte` | L |
| 5 | **Component state machine** | Inputs, graph editor, transition conditions, stage preview with input toggles, runtime interpreter | `engine-layout` (`stateMachine.ts`), new editor panel | L |
| 6 | **Listeners** | Pointer events on nodes → inputs | `engine-layout`, `EditorProperties` | M |
| 7 | **Flow attachment** | Flow v2 nodes *Set Input*, *Fire Trigger*, *Wait for State*, *On State Entered*, typed per instance; validator checks refs | `engine-flow-v2`, `/flow-v2`, `apps/lines` interpreter | M |
| 8 | **Migrate the coded overlays** | Transition → Win → free-spin intro/outro → buttons, behind a flag, then retire the coded mounts (§8.7 "defang, don't gut") | `apps/lines`, built-in components | L each |
| 9 | **Shared library + UX pass** | `_shared/cinematics/` promotion and starter timelines; hierarchy lock/hide/solo, shortcuts, onion skin | editor, storage | M |

**Ship chain (rule 8):** no new asset class. Timelines already travel export → deploy → bake →
pull → register as cinematics. What a node-actor timeline references must also ship: art it swaps
(frames, tints are values) and the FX/sounds its cues fire. Phase 1 adds those to
`collectArtRefs` / `cinematicRigNames` and extends `check:art-scope`.

**Why this order:** Phases 1–3 reuse what exists and give the first visible result: animate a
screen's intro in the Scene Editor, have Flow play it. Components, state machines and Flow inputs
build on that one timeline system rather than a new one.

## 7. Alternatives considered

- **Embed the real Rive runtime and import `.riv` files.** Rive draws with its own renderer, not
  PixiJS, so it would not share our atlases, rigs, FX, fonts, device layouts or the bake chain.
  **Not recommended** as the core path.
- **A second timeline just for components** (the old §17 `BehaviorTrack` plan). Two keyframe
  engines, two UIs, two formats. Rejected per owner direction: timelines must be reusable.
- **Rebuild the sequencer in Svelte and embed it in `/rigger`.** Cleaner end state, but it
  re-does a live-verified tool and puts every cinematic gate at risk at once. Extracting the
  existing panel (Phase 2) is lower risk.

## 8. Open decisions (owner)

1. **Lift the §8.7 deferral** for *component* state machines (screens stay on Flow, §2)?
2. **Merge `/components` into `/editor`** (Phase 4), or keep two pages that share the new panels?
3. **Name.** Keep calling the shared timeline a *Cinematic* everywhere, or rename it *Timeline*
   in the UI (the file format can stay `.icin`)?
4. **Inputs vs signals:** fold `signals` into trigger inputs (one concept, signals read as
   triggers for back-compat), or keep both?
5. **Which proof first** for Phase 3: a screen intro, the `Transition` overlay, or the Win banner?
6. **Rive references.** Screenshots or a short recording of the Rive screens you want copied
   would sharpen Phases 4 and 9.
