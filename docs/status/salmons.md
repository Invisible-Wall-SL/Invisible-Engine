# Salmons (arcade reference project) — status

> Plan: [design/game-families.md](../design/game-families.md) §1 (Salmons and its art pass, S0), §4.3–§4.5, P10.16, §9 #28 · Online rooms: [design/realtime-multiplayer.md](../design/realtime-multiplayer.md) · The art pass's own guide: `docs/art-pass.md` in `GuiltyForever/Salmon-` · The sample it builds on: [playtest/arcade-sample.md](../playtest/arcade-sample.md) · Agents: `arcade-games` (art pass: `atlas-python-tools`, `invisible-flipbook`, `invisible-fx`, `invisible-components`)

**One-line state:** **Salmons is rebuilt as data on the engine (P10.16, built 2026-10-27; in
review)**: its river, rules, characters, bots and layout run on the shared runtime and the game
server, with placeholder looks, and play in two browsers and a room of bots
([playtest/salmons.md](../playtest/salmons.md)). It is not in the `salmons` portal project yet, and
its players are not moved over: both are owner steps (below). The art pass (S0) was approved on
2026-10-26; its 22 character clips are still to be generated in the launcher's tools, and replace
the placeholders when they are.

## Current state

- **Salmons on the engine (P10.16)** — all generated from one seed, `SALMONS_SEED`:
  - **the river and the config**: `engine-mechanics` `src/salmons.js` (`salmonsRiver`,
    `salmonsConfig`): a 1800 × 7200 river of 15 bands from the sea to the source; `salmon`,
    `bear` (≤ 30) and `fisherman` (≤ 20); bears and fishermen start on the banks; 100 players; bots
    fill each room to 20 as bears and fishermen and cannot win (§14 #5); a new round 15 s after one
    ends (§14 #6); each device is sent the players within 2400 × 1800 of its own;
  - **today's rules, as data** (realtime-multiplayer §4's table): the current and whirlpools are
    zone forces on salmon (rapids push harder); a bank pushes a salmon back into the water; the
    bear's swipe (110 px, out 3 s, +1) and the fisherman's cast (280 px, out 4 s, +2) are `catch`
    abilities on J; the first salmon at the source wins (+10);
  - **not yet built** (Salmons' own rules, a rules module each — P10.15 open item c): the climb up
    a waterfall by tapping, sandbanks that ground a salmon until it jumps, rocks and one-way
    waterfalls as solids, and the fisherman's line (hook, reel, land: today one catch); the golden
    salmon; a new river per room (§14 #4: today every room plays the one seed's river);
  - **the layout and looks**: `engine-layout` `referenceLayouts/salmons.ts` — the river as the
    play field's world, a camera following the device's own player, placeholder looks
    (`salmonsSalmon`, `salmonsBear`, `salmonsFisherman`); no HUD or round-over screen until room
    events and scores reach Flow (P10.15's open item);
  - **proof**: `check:room-bots` (a salmon swims the river to the source and wins; a bear bot
    catches one; the config validates clean), `scripts/playtest/salmons-play.mjs` (14 / 14), and
    the 100-device load test ([status/game-families](game-families.md) P10.16).
- **The Salmons that players reach today is not built from this repository.** It lives in
  `GuiltyForever/Salmon-` (a Colyseus 0.15 server and a PixiJS client) and deploys from there.
  Nothing merged here changes it until its players are moved over (owner steps below).
- **S0's groundwork, in the Salmon repository** (`main` 41811c2, read 2026-10-26; its
  `docs/art-pass.md` owns the detail):
  - the original images are kept untouched in `art/source/legacy/` (16 files);
    `scripts/build-sheets.py` packs them with the Atlas Maker's own packer into `terrain`,
    `props` and `characters` sheets (TexturePacker JSON) and a FlipbookDoc `clips.json`, so a
    sheet or clip exported from the pipeline drops in;
  - the look is fixed: 2:1 isometric, painted cartoon with dark outlines, sizes on screen, frames
    generated at about 4×, a bottom-centre anchor, real transparency;
  - facings: four diagonals, drawn south-east and north-east and mirrored for the west;
  - the client already plays clips named `<character>_<state>_<facing>` as soon as they exist
    (`client/rendering/characterLook.js`), falling back to the old drawings until then;
  - recipes: Atlas Maker `gpt_image` stills with the current art as the style reference and a
    BiRefNet cutout, then Flipbook 🎬 Video with `wan22_i2v_flipbook`, then download through the
    FTP Browser into `art/imported/` and rebuild;
  - `art/imported/` is empty: no clip has been generated.
- **The `salmons` portal project** (client `invisible_wall`) is an **arcade project** since
  2026-10-26: Game Config family `arcade` ("Salmon Run", free play), the arcade scene set, the four
  sample components, the arcade starter flow, published to the test server. It plays the P10.8
  dodger with placeholder shapes. Before that it held only a test background (`Background_Test_1`,
  still there) and an unused Book-of flow (kept under `editor/flow-v2-backups/`). None of the
  Salmon repository's sheets is in it: that repository builds them locally.
- **The two design docs' disagreement is settled:** realtime-multiplayer §2 item 4 is right that
  the art is in the pipeline's formats; game-families §1 now says what is left.

## Owner steps (P10.16) — not done by the build

1. **Put Salmons in the `salmons` project.** Run
   `node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings --import ./scripts/ts-loader.mjs scripts/salmons/export.mjs --out <dir>`
   and upload what it writes, at the same keys, into R2 (the FTP Browser, admin full-bucket):
   `invisible_wall/salmons/config/config.json` (replaces the dodger's config),
   `invisible_wall/salmons/editor/scenes.json` (replaces its screens) and the three
   `editor/salmons/components/salmons*.json`. Back up the current three first.
2. **Remove the arcade starter flow** from the project (`invisible_wall/salmons/editor/flow-v2.json`,
   after a backup): it is an offline flow, and Salmons has none yet.
3. **Publish** `salmons` from Game Maker. The publish does not yet write the game server's address
   into the launch URL (P10.14 open item 1b), so open it with
   `?rooms_url=wss://rooms.invisiblewall.org` added.
4. **The game server's config credential** (INFRA "Invisible Game Server" steps 5–7), so the live
   server can read the published config; until then it plays no game.
5. **Moving the players over** from the Salmon repository's own server: when the art and the
   missing rules (above) are in and you are happy with a playtest on the live server.

## Open items / next (S0)

Salmons' own rules (the climb, sandbanks, solids, the line, the golden salmon), its HUD and
round-over screen, the published `rooms_url`, a river per room and the isometric view are
scheduled in [Phase 11](../design/phase-11.md) (P11.2–P11.4); S0 runs beside them.

1. **Generate the 22 character clips** in the project `salmons`, following the Salmon repository's
   `docs/art-pass.md` recipes: `salmon_pink` and `salmon_golden` (`swim`, `hop`, `caught`), `bear`
   (`idle`, `walk`, `swipe`), `fisherman` (`idle`, `walk`, `cast`, `reel`), each `_se` and `_ne`.
   The salmon (drawn side-on) and the bear (drawn from above) matter most; they are the off-angle
   ones. The golden salmon may be the pink one recoloured with a `_colour` FX layer.
2. **The arcade sample's four sprites** (§9 #6), for a result in the shared runtime: the salmon,
   bear, hook and fish stills from item 1 and the props sheet, re-skinning `arcadeSalmon` /
   `arcadeBear` / `arcadeHook` / `arcadeFish` and sizing the config bodies to the art
   ([status/game-families](game-families.md) open item 11), in the `salmons` project.
3. **Lower priority, from the art pass's list:** the bridge pieces (generated placeholders today)
   and drawn tiles for the riverbed, water surface and sea (drawn in code today; the Salmon client
   needs a small change to use them).
4. **Back into the Salmon repository:** each generated sheet and clip is downloaded into
   `art/imported/` and `build-sheets.py` re-run, so today's game shows the new art before the
   rebuild.

Shipping (rule 8): atlases, clips and effects already travel export → deploy → bake → pull →
register. Tiles and characters get their chains in P10.13 and P10.11. S0 adds no asset class.

## Decided (owner, 2026-10-26)

- **Models:** licence-clean only. The art pass's recipes already are: `gpt_image` (clear), a
  BiRefNet cutout instead of the default RMBG-2.0, and Wan 2.2 for video
  ([model-licences](../reference/model-licences.md)).
- **Project:** the `salmons` project is reused for the rebuild, replacing what is in it. The
  original game stays safe in its repository.
- **Facings:** a per-game option, 4 or 8 (game-families §9 #28). Salmons draws 4.

## Blocked (owner / external)

- **The generation runs in the launcher's tools** (ComfyUI on RunPod, through the Atlas Maker,
  Flipbook and FX). They are pages behind the launcher's sign-in, and a cloud session has no
  launcher account, no R2 write and no ComfyUI. Items 1–3 need a person at those tools.

## Recent changes

- 2026-10-27 — **P10.16: Salmons rebuilt as data on the engine.** The river generator and the
  online config (`engine-mechanics` `salmons.js`), its layout (`engine-layout`
  `referenceLayouts/salmons.ts`), the export for the project, `docs/playtest/salmons.md` and its
  playtest (14 / 14). Bots, nearby-only state and the load test are in
  [status/game-families](game-families.md) P10.16. Placeholder looks; owner steps above.

- 2026-10-26 — **`salmons` became an arcade project; the owner keeps it as the art test bed.**
  The owner switched its kind in `/admin` and re-scaffolded. The re-scaffold writes only missing
  files, so the old Book-of `editor/flow-v2.json` survived. Its first publish (08:21) was an arcade
  runtime driven by a slot flow, and the game was broken. The fix:
  1. delete `editor/flow-v2.json`;
  2. re-scaffold again;
  3. publish without editing the flow.

  An edit that deletes the starter's `complete:loading` chain leaves the loading screen up after
  the tap. The owner expected the real Salmons and got the generic dodger. The original game is
  untouched in its own repository, and Salmons on the engine is still P10.16.

- 2026-10-26 — **Step 0 done: read the Salmon repository and recorded the owner's three choices.**
  The S0 groundwork was already there (above), so the work list is now the 22 clips plus the
  lower-priority pieces. Facings became §9 #28. The R2 read of `salmons` stands.
- 2026-10-26 — **S0 approved by the owner; this file opened.** The owner asked why the
  coordinating session never raised S0. Nothing it reads said an owner go was pending: S0 was
  written as "not a build step", so it had no row in game-families §8 (the table the coordinator
  walks), and it was never listed under STATUS.md's owner blockers. S0 now has a row in §8 and an
  entry in STATUS.md's owner list.
